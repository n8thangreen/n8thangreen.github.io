At this yearâ€™s Royal Statistical Society Conference in Brighton, this session revisited a topic first explored by the late Sir David Cox. His seminal paper, presented at the 50th anniversary of the Italian Statistical Society, examined the evolving dynamics between statisticians and "substantive research workers." This session aimed to assess how much progress has been made in the 35 years since that paper and whether the challenges identified by Cox still persist.

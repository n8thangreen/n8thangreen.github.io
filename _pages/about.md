I am a Research Fellow in the [Department of Statistical Science](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/statistics/), UCL. I am also involved with the Statistics, Modelling and Economics Department at Public Health England. I have a number of years experience working on a wide range of projects across government and academia in defence and health. I studied mathematics and statistics at the University of Newcastle-Upon-Tyne and obtained a PhD in applied probability from the University of Liverpool. After working for the Ministry of Defence for several years, applying novel Bayesian Inference ideas, I moved back into academia and the field of public health in 2010. I have recently worked in oncology, tuberculosis, healthcare-acquired infections and sexually transmitted infections.

My general fields of interest include health economics, survival analysis and multistate models, and epidemiology. I am also a keen R programmer.

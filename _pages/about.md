I am a Research Fellow in the [Department of Statistical Science](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/statistics/), UCL. I am also involved with the Statistics, Modelling and Economics Department at Public Health England.

I have a number of years experience working on a wide range of projects across government and academia in defence and health.

I studied mathematics and statistics at the University of Newcastle-Upon-Tyne and obtained a PhD in applied probability from the University of Liverpool. After working for the Ministry of Defence for several years, applying novel Bayesian Inference ideas, I moved back into academia and the field of public health in 2010.

I have recently worked on tuberculosis (latent and active cases), healthcare-acquired infections and sexually transmitted infections (principally Chlamydia).

My general fields of interest include:

* Operational research
* Health economics
* Survival analysis and multistate models
* Epidemiology
* Small area estimation

My current methodological interests include:

* Care pathway analysis
* Excess length of stay estimation
* Cost-effectiveness
* Multi-level modelling of spatio-temporal data, including aggregation of disparate sources
* Discrete event simulation (DES)


My current application areas include
* oncology
* clinical trials
* HTA

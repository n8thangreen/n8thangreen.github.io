  * Bayesian Cost Effectiveness Analysis. Given the results of a Bayesian model (possibly based on MCMC) in the form of simulations from the posterior distributions of suitable variables of costs and clinical benefits for two or more interventions, produces a health economic evaluation. Compares one of the interventions (the "reference") to the others ("comparators"). Produces many summary and plots to analyse the results.

  * Create a blended curve from two survival curves, which is particularly useful
          for survival extrapolation in health technology assessment. The main idea is to
          mix a flexible model that fits the observed data well with a parametric model that
          encodes assumptions about long-term survival. The two curves are blended into a
          single survival curve that is identical to the first model over the range of 
          observed times and gradually approaches the parametric model over the extrapolation
          period based on a given weight function. This approach allows for the inclusion of
          external information, such as data from registries or expert opinion, to guide
          long-term extrapolations, especially when dealing with immature trial data.
